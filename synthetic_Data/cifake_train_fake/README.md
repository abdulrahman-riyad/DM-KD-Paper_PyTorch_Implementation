# CIFAKE Synthetic Images (train/FAKE)

Place the 50,000 synthetic AI-generated images (originally from the `train/FAKE` directory of the CIFAKE dataset) here. These images should follow a naming convention where the original CIFAR-10 class can be inferred from the filename for the data loaders to work correctly.

Refer to the `README.md` in the parent `synthetic_data` directory for download links.
